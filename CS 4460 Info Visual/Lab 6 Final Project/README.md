We have imported Transportation Fatalities By Year data into our code and made two visualizations, a line graph and a scatterplot.

To view the charts appropriately start an http server. Call python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 (for Python 2) or python -m http.server 8080 (for Python 3) on terminal. 

Next, On the web brower, type http://localhost:8080/. 

Then, a line graph will be shown on top and scatterplot will be shown on the bottom.

To find a particular data on this line graph, put a mouse on the dot you would like to find. 

For the graph on the bottom, use dropdown menu on the right to view different types of data, such as Pedestrian, Motorcycle, Bicycle, and Trucks.

To find a particular data for this scatterplot, put a mouse on the dot and you will be able to find the year.
